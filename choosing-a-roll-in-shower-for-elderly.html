    <p>For many seniors and older adults, traditional tubs and high-curb showers pose a serious risk for slips, falls, or difficulty entering and exiting. The bathroom is one of the most dangerous rooms in the home: studies show that falls among older adults are common and often happen during bathing, showering or getting in/out of tubs or showers.

    <h2>Why roll in showers make sense</h2>
    <p>Roll in (or curbless / barrier-free) showers eliminate the step-over barrier — which reduces trip and fall risk significantly. (<a href="https://www.affordablewalkinshower.com/blog/curbless-walk-in-shower-bathroom-remodeling" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Affordable Walk In Shower</a>) Add a textured, non-slip floor, sturdy grab bars, and a shower seat and you get a bathing space designed for mobility limitations and balance challenges.

    <h3>Key things to check before ordering or installing</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Threshold height & entry type</strong> — ideally zero-entry or very low curb (< ½ inch)</li>
      <li><strong>Drain style</strong> — trench drains or linear drains for smoother rolling</li>
      <li><strong>Floor texture</strong> — non-slip surfaces matter</li>
      <li><strong>Grab bars & seating</strong> — essential safety features</li>
      <li><strong>Clear floor space</strong> for turning mobility devices</li>
      <li><strong>Lighting & control placement</strong> — hand-held wands and reachable controls</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>When a roll in shower is the right choice</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Mobility limitations</li>
      <li>Balance concerns</li>
      <li>Walker or wheelchair use</li>
      <li>Assistance from a caregiver</li>
      <li>Want fast, easy bathing</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If someone prefers soaking and hydrotherapy, a walk in tub might still be ideal. Many homes combine both solutions — roll in shower for daily use, walk in tub for therapeutic soaks.</p>
